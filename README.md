## üßÆ Code Nest Admin Dashboard - Developer Documentation

### 1. üìå Project Overview

This project is an **admin dashboard for "Code Nest"**, a platform to manage coding problems and monitor platform activity. It provides a full-featured interface for administrators to perform **CRUD operations** on coding problems and view **platform analytics** such as user activity, problem distribution, and submission trends. Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **TypeScript**, it uses **PrimeReact** and **Tailwind CSS** for UI, **Supabase** for authentication, and **json-server** as a mock API for problem data.

### 4. üß© Open Source Libraries Used & Customization

- **PrimeReact**:
    - `DataTable` customized with `difficultyBodyTemplate`, `actionBodyTemplate`, etc.
    - `Toast` component for feedback after user actions.
    - Composed UI with `Card`, `InputText`, `Dropdown`, and `Button`.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness.
- **Supabase**: Auth with email/password and Google OAuth; session-based route protection.
- **json-server**: Used to mock REST API endpoints with pagination and filters.
- **React Hook Form**: Used for problem form validation and input control.
- **Axios**: Configured for client-server API calls.

**Customization Highlights**:

- PrimeReact DataTable is extended with dynamic icon rendering and custom action buttons.
- Authentication flow is split between server-side and client-side using Supabase utilities.
- Admin activity is tracked and logged using a helper API function.

### 5. ‚è±Ô∏è Task Estimation

- **Estimated time for a trainee or beginner (without AI):** 10‚Äì15 working days
    
    This includes setting up Supabase, creating CRUD forms, configuring filters, understanding PrimeReact composition, and implementing route protection and analytics.
    
- **Estimated time with AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude):** 3-5 working days
    
    AI support accelerates layout generation, REST API handling, Supabase auth integration, and form validation with libraries like `react-hook-form`.
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

1. **Authentication Flow**: Supabase integration on both client and server requires deep understanding of session management ( backward compatibility issues has been detected).
2. **JSON SERVER:** You have to go through documentation as AI generate outdated code

### 6. üß† Potential AI Hallucinations / Debugging Notes

| Area | Possible Issue | Debugging Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase Auth | AI might suggest outdated or client-only login methods | Use server-side helpers in `action.ts` for consistent session handling |
| json-server | AI may assume full REST support (e.g., PATCH, nested routes) | Stick to simple query param patterns supported by json-server |
| PrimeReact DataTable | AI could hallucinate props that don't exist (e.g., `columnKey`) | Refer to official PrimeReact DataTable API |

### 7. üå± Suggested Features

1. **User Management Tab**
    
    Create `/dashboard/users` to list and manage users fetched from Supabase. Include role or status toggling.
    
2. **Bulk Import/Export**
    
    Add CSV/JSON upload to mass-import problems. Also, implement export of filtered problems list.
    
3. **Advanced Analytics**
    
    Add stacked bar charts for problem submission trends by difficulty or timeframe to track platform engagement.
